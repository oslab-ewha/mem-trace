# Memory trace for smartphone

The memory access traces of five Android applications were captured by using a modified version of the Cachegrind tool from the Valgrind toolset. Each trace file contains two columns: logical page number and access type. The access type column can be one of instruction read (I), data read (R), or data write (W). The logical page number column is listed in decimal.
